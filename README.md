# Mobile-Data-Collector
Due to climate change, farming high quality coffee is becoming increasingly more difficult. So I put some hardware/software together so I could provide a local farm with some meaningful data to work with. Hopefully in time, improving harvests, and leading to higher quality beans. 

More setup details and instructions coming soon.
